Enter a description in the Token description field, like \"Visual Studio token\".\r\n3. Click Create Token.\r\n4. Your new Personal Access token will be displayed.\r\n5. Copy this token, and enter it in the Token text box in the logon dialog. You can now log in as usual.\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to revoke the token, visit the GitHub Applications settings page and click Delete next to the key you wish to remove.\r\n\r\n## Credits ##\r\n\r\n- Button and application images by [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) ([SIL OFL 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL))\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n\r\n### Login Window ###\r\n\r\n![Login](/images/logon.png)\r\n\r\n### Issue List ###\r\n\r\n![Issue List](/images/issue_list.png)\r\n\r\n### Issue Window ###\r\n\r\n![Issue Window](/images/issue.png)\r\n\r\n## Building ##\r\n\r\nThis project supports Visual Studio 2012 and newer.

Note that if these values are not set, the\r\nonly supported authentication method will be specifying an access token generated according\r\nto the steps described in **Two Factor Authentication**, above.\r\n\r\nTo debug, \r\n\r\n1. Set `GitHubExtension` as the startup project\r\n2. Select **Debug** &rarr; **Start Debugging**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
